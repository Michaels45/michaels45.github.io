				<h2>23/08/2021</h2>
				<p>Today I was graphing and analyzing my observations from my research <br>
					part of the first assignment. I also started making my low fidelity sketches.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>24/08/2021</h2>
				<p>Today I showed some people the low fidelity sketches and got some <br>
					feedback. I also started designing a couple of logos.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>25/08/2021</h2>
				<p>I continued finishing my research assignment report by relating <br>
					statistical observations to the personas that I created and clarified <br>
					the target market for my product. I also started putting my logo <br>
					designs based off feedback into my design system.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>26/08/2021</h2>
				<p>From the hand drawn wireframes, I got told that I should Replace the<br>
					 titles on the 5 option navigation tab with icons instead. I decided<br>
					  to alter the information architecture of my app.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>27/08/2021</h2>
				<p>I started selecting color schemes and different logo variations for <br>
					both dark and light colors but also for the iPad and iPhone versions <br>
					of my app. I did this by searching the Internet and deciding that I <br>
					wanted to use in NZ green based theme.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>28/08/2021</h2>
				<p>I started finding icons and mobile user interface kits that that <br>
					would help me in creating this. I also decided on using the inter<br>
					 font and I found some visual language and user interface elements <br>
					 that I want to use.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>29/08/2021</h2>
				<p>I started doing my low fidelity digital designs for the iPhone version<br>
					 of the app. I collected the five users’ feedback and wrote this in my <br>
					 report document.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>30/08/2021</h2>
				<p>This feedback allowed me to create a version two of the iPhone low <br>
					fidelity digital wireframe. and yet again I conducted more usability<br>
					 testing with the same users.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>31/08/2021</h2>
				<p>So after this I collected their feedback and wrote it in the report<br>
					 yet again and I decided to create a version three of the low fidelity <br>
					 digital iPhone wireframe. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>1/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I had created some very basic sketches for the iPad version however <br>
					now I started creating the low fidelity digital version of the wireframes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>2/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I collected feedback from the users on the iPad version of the wire <br>
					frame. I implemented the fixes they recommended.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>3/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I started creating the iPhone high fidelity wire frame. I also decided <br>
					on the fonts and more visual elements. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>4/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I got some more feedback and decided to create a version two of the<br>
					 IPhone app design in Figma. this design looked a lot better to me.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>5/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I quickly prototyped this design and gave it to the user to give me feedback.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>6/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I also created the iPad version of the high-fidelity wireframe and it's prototype.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>7/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I gave this to the users for feedback again, yet again filling out <br>
					my report with their feedback.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>8/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I made a lot of changes to the designs my favorite was probably<br>
					 cutting down the size of the order online menu in the iPad version of<br>
					  the app. I really enjoyed theming and editing the images used in the<br>
						 categories for the meals to filter the shopping list.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>9/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I added some more content to the voice user interface to show users<br>
					 how it could be used.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<h2>10/09/2021</h2>
				<p>I started collecting a lot of all of the things I had done on separate <br>
					documents in  regards to this assignment to make my one final report document</p>
			</div>
